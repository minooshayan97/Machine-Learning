### The first question

The data of two classes in two-dimensional space is given as follows:
$$ \set{(0,-1),(1,0),(2,1),(1,1),(-1,1),(-1,-1),(-1,-1)} $$
1. Obtain the main components.
2. Map the data on the first component.
3. Reconstruct the original values using the mapped values.
4. Show the initial values and the reconstructed values in the picture.
The process should be done descriptively.

### The second question
Two files named npy.set_train and npy.set_test are provided with the exercises, which is the data set of the second exercise.

1. First, display the training and test data in two-dimensional space.
2. Using LDA, map the data to a one-dimensional space and train the model using perceptron or linear regression, report the error on the training and test data. visualize the incorrectly classified data.
3. Using PCA, map the data to one-dimensional space and perform other steps similar to the previous part.
4. Between the results of LDA and PCA, conclude which one is better and why.
Note: Test data should only be used for final evaluation and should not be used in any training phase.
It is suggested to standardize the data first
