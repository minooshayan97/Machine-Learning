In this exercise, the goal is to classify a two-class dataset using the perceptron method. In these data, each data has characteristics obtained by processing the images of original and fake banknotes. The last column of each row represents its data category. Report the accuracy of the classifier on both training data and test data. During the training process, you can set the learning rate to about 0.001.
For better understanding, show the first two characteristics of the data and specify in the picture which data is wrongly classified by your designed classifier. Justify your observations regarding these data.
