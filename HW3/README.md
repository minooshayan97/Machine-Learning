### The first question
The data of two classes in two-dimensional space is given as below, using LDA method, find the best vector that has the largest distance according to LDA criteria after mapping the data of two classes on it. Report the LDA criteria along with the optimal parameters of the model and the final results obtained. The process should be done descriptively.

$$ c_0 = \set {(0,-1),(1,0),(2,1)} $$

$$ c_1 = {(1,1),(-1,1),(-1,-1),(-1,-1)}$$

### The second question
In this exercise, the goal is to classify a two-class dataset using the LDA method. In this database, each data has characteristics obtained by processing the images of original and fake banknotes. The last column of each row represents its data category.

1. First, train the data with the perceptron model or linear regression and report the amount of error on the training and test data and attach a picture of the fitted data and the incorrectly fitted data.
Now move the data to 1D space using LDA and then repeat the above process again, in addition to the above requests, report the LDA benchmark and display the data moved to 1D space.

2. Investigate what effect the use of LDA had on the test error.
Before feeding the data to LDA, first standardize the data.
